        <h1>What is a QA Tester</h1>
        <p class="lotOfWords">A QA (quality assurance) tester helps make sure that clients or end users will not end up with faulty software.
            They do this by running tests to try to break the software or make it malfunction in as many ways possible, so that the developers will now what to fix before releasing their product.

                     allowing for easier identification of issues. 
                     Once unit testing is complete, they progress to component testing, 
                     which involves testing the interaction between multiple units of code.
